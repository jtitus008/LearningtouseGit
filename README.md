# LearningtouseGit
This is my attempt to learn to push and pull from Git

- To start, I'm working through the "hellow world" section of the Git repository. This will hopefully help me to be able to understand more about what I'm doing in GIT and I'll then be able to pull and push my repository from my code editor in short order.

# Commit to GIT
- I am now about to attempt to commit back to the GIT repo, where I pulled this from.
